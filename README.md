*(In your case, everything is in one HTML file, but you may split it later.)*

## 🧠 How it Works

- Users register or log in (data is stored locally).
- After login, the homepage appears with categories like **Action**, **Comedy**, **Drama**, etc.
- Clicking on any movie card opens a YouTube trailer in a modal.
- Watched movies appear under the "Continue Watching" section.
